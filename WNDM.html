<p><span class="cnsm-theme">1st Workshop on Wireless Networks Deployment and Management (WNDM)</span>
  <br/>
  <span class="cn-blue">Monday 28 October 2024</span></p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>Nowadays multiple wireless networks coexist in unlicensed spectra, relying on access nodes that belong to multiple technologies and with mobile devices equipped with wireless interfaces from multiple technologies. Furthermore, each wireless technology includes a number of complex features to be optimized. In this setting, advanced handling of complex features, such as resource allocation or link selection to name a few, is likely expected to help in the optimization, deployment, and management stages. AI/ML-assisted methodologies likely will help to address the joint optimization of multiple features also in scenarios in which multiple technologies coexist in unlicensed spectra. The workshop covers the methodological aspects, including AI/ML-assisted wireless network deployment and management, for the optimization of wireless networks, advanced tools, and the integration of tools for proper modeling and evaluation of complex wireless networks.</p>

<p> The workshop seeks regular papers from research centers and academia for demonstrations of novel work and work-in-progress in the context of AI/ML-assisted optimization strategies of complex wireless networks deployment and management, advanced tools, and integration of multiple tools/approaches for proper modeling and evaluation of complex coexisting wireless networks. Additionally, the workshop seeks talks on very early-stage research or in tutorial style on advanced tools.</p>

<h3>Paper Submission Guideline</h3>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers not under review elsewhere. Papers should be submitted in IEEE 2-column format (Style templates can be found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  Maximum paper lengths, including title, abstract, all figures, tables, and references, are 7 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers.

Regular paper length could include up to 7 pages including references. Short papers are accepted as well and must not exceed 4 pages including references.  </p>

<p> Papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EDAS conference management system, accessible via this <a href="https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=32709" target="_blank">link</a>.
</p>




<p>All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and selected based on their originality, significance, technical soundness, and relevance to the workshopâ€™s theme. For accepted papers, at least one author is expected to register and present the paper in person at the workshop. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore.</p>
