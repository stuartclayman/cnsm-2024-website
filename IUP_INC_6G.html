<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>In-Network Computing (INC) is a currently emerging concept, that has constantly been gaining relevance in the past couple of years, among others due to the ongoing advancements in programmable networking hardware (e.g. smart NICs) and the development of network programming languages, such as P4. Deploying INC in 6G Mobile Networks would mean that the User Plane is significantly enhanced in terms of its capabilities: Instead of just forwarding the data packets of a flow, 6G Access Nodes (ANs) and User Plane Functions (UPFs) can simultaneously compute on the packet’s contents. This convergence of communication and compute capabilities can be referred to as the concept of an Intelligent User Plane. INC enables running different functions within network nodes, such as in-network analytics (e.g., data aggregation, packet inspection, machine learning inference pipeline), in-network caching (e.g., information-centric based), in-network security (e.g., firewalling, attack detection), thus providing secure and distributed intelligence, with benefits in terms of access delay, load balancing, and bandwidth consumption. Several research associations (e.g., one6G), renowned companies (e.g., Intel), and standardization development organizations such as the IETF/IRTF hype INC as one of the potential key enabling technologies for future networks, including 6G.  </p>

<p>
INC has an incredibly wide range of application areas, including robotics, video streaming, industrial IoT, Machine Learning, and many more. It can support novel 6G use-cases by its potential to optimize various network KPIs, such as the end-to-end latency, network traffic volume, or the UE energy efficiency. We encourage the submission of practical papers that may present measurements and performance studies relating to IUP/INC, as well as conceptual papers focusing on novel architectures and protocols for realizing INC (including control plane und user plane enhancements). The workshop shall attract authors and attendees from academia and industry likewise and provide them a common stage for discussing future directions on the topic.
