<h1>CNSM 2024 Distinguished Expert Panel</h1>


<h2 class="cn-blue">AI-Powered Network and Service Management for Tomorrow's Digital World</h2>

<p  class="cnsm-theme">
The theme of this year's CNSM 2024 is "AI-Powered Network and Service
Management for Tomorrow's Digital World".  This theme reflects the
expectation that AI technology will make a lasting impact on the field
of network and service management and take center stage in the coming
years.  However, this raises the question how this impact will manifest
itself.  For example, will AI lead mainly to greater operational
efficiencies, or will AI help tackle previously unsolved problems and
perhaps lead to entirely new categories of management functionality?
Will the introduction of AI itself require new management approaches,
from ways to dealing with uncertainties and nondeterminism to addressing
issues of compliance and constraints imposed by regulation with regards
to privacy?  Will management protocols and data models need to evolve to
become more "AI-ready"?  Which areas are prone to setbacks where
realities may not be able to keep up with expectations; which problems
will remain despite advances in AI and which new challenges may emerge
because of it?
