<h3>How to get here</h3>
<p>
  The easiest way how to get to conference is to use a metro, tram or bus to Staroměstská station and then you can walk or take a tram number 17 or 18 for a one stop to the Karlovy lážně station. If you use a tram you will have our building on your your right side. You will go a few steps backwards against the direction of your travel by tram and turn left before you go into underpass.

<p>
“Novotného lávka“, on the right bank of the Vltava River near the Charles Bridge and Smetana Embankment, is made up of historic buildings, originally water mills, with a rich history. Already in 1396 there were 10 mills here.  In 1489, the first wooden water tower was built here, which was later replaced by a stone tower in 1577. Over the centuries, the footbridge has undergone changes of ownership and naming. In 1870 it was called the Old Town footbridge, but in 1885 it was renamed in honour of the miller Karel Novotný (1827-1900), who built the existing iron footbridge.
</p>

<p>
Today these historic buildings, owned by the Czech Association of Scientific and Technical Socies, have been converted into spaces for education, culture, gastronomy and entertainment. 
</p>

<p>
Also worth mentioning is the Old Town Waterworks at the end of the footbridge with a direct view of Hradčany, rebuilt in 1883 to a design by Antonín Wiehl, decorated with sgraffiti by Mikoláš Alš, František Ženíšek and Jan Koula. Since 1936 it has housed the Bedřich Smetana Museum.
</p>

<p>
Like time, the Vltava River flows beneath this place as an endless source of energy, inspiration and life.

      Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is one of the most attractive and most visited cities in Europe. The city offers its visitors a breathtaking historical atmosphere, presenting architectural masterpieces ranging from the Roman era basilicas to the art nouveau, functionalist and cubist houses of the 20th century. We invite you to visit, among other places, the unique large complex of Prague Castle overlooking the city from one of its hills, to walk over the Charles Bridge built in the 14th century, and to wander the narrow romantic streets of the Lesser Town and Old Town. Prague will also unveil itself to you as a busy, modern Central European center of culture and business with numerous restaurants, bars, music clubs, galleries and concert halls, and, of course, friendly people.
