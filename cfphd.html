<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The PhD workshop is co-located with CNSM 2024 in Prague and is being organized for the first time in this manner. It covers a wide range of network and service management topics. The workshop spans two days, with the first day on Sunday dedicated to the PhD school. Lectures will focus on essential aspects of network security, traffic analysis, advanced network solutions, and best practices in research and development. Each lecture will be accompanied by practical sessions, allowing students to apply learned concepts. The program will be published here as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Every registered student will be asked to submit a poster about their current research, which may include visions, research plans, state-of-the-art analyses, proof of concepts, preliminary results, or work in progress. Participants will benefit from constructive feedback and networking opportunities and enhance their presentation skills through “poster teaser” (lightning talk) sessions.</p>

<p>This series of events offers a unique opportunity for participants to gain knowledge, share their work, and connect with peers and experts in the field.</p>
