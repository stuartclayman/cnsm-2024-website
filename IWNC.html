<h2>IWNC 2024</h2>

<p><span class="cnsm-theme">1st Workshop on Integrated Wireless Networking and Computing (IWNC)</span>
  <br/>
  <span class="cn-blue">Monday 28 October 2024 14.00 - 17.30</span></p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>Modern wireless networks, including IoT, Wi-Fi, and 5G/6G, incorporate numerous complex features that require optimization. Advanced handling of these features (e.g., resource allocation and link selection) is expected to significantly enhance the optimization, deployment, and management stages of these networks. AI/ML-assisted methodologies will likely play a pivotal role in addressing the joint optimization of multiple features.</p>

<p>Additionally, In-Network Computing (INC) is an emerging concept that has gained substantial relevance in recent years, driven by advancements in programmable networking hardware (e.g., smart NICs) and the development of network programming languages such as P4.</p>

<p>This workshop invites research papers from academia and research centers that demonstrate novel work in the fields of integrated wireless networking and computing, AI/ML-assisted optimization strategies, In-Network Computing, and early-stage research.</p>

<em>In-Network Computing for Immersive Applications in 6G: The Case of Holographic Telepresence</em>
</p>


Abstract

<p>
ITU-R has now defined the usage scenarios and overreaching architectural aspects of 6G. Immersive
communications is among these scenarios and holographic telepresence, an archetype application, is
expected to play a critical role in the future- in settings such as work, social interactions, tele-education
and remote live performances. Telepresence has the very challenging characteristic of requiring 6G
Massive Communications (MC) in addition to 6G Hyper Reliable and Low Latency Communications
(HRLLC). While HRLLC might meet the latency needs of holographic telepresence, MC is more likely to
fall short when it comes to the bandwidth needs. Thus, the need for new technologies in 6G landscape.
In-Network Computing (INC) is certainly one of these technologies due to its potential for reducing
network load and latency. However, inducting INC in 6G landscape brings many challenges. An example
is the Management and Orchestration (MANO) of INC components, seeing that the existing ETSI MANO
for 5G deals solely with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) components. In this keynote speech, we
start by introducing the potential of INC and illustrate it with concrete measurements on prototypes,
including the remote live concert prototype built by our lab. The challenges posed by the induction of
INC in 6G landscape are then identified and some very early solutions are presented, with a focus on
MANO. The research directions are also sketched.
