<p><span class="cnsm-theme">1st Workshop on Blockchain-enabled Network Management and Orchestration in 6G Era (BLOCK-6G)</span>
  <br/>
  <span class="cn-blue">Monday 28 October 2024</span></p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The advent of the 6G era brings forth unprecedented challenges and opportunities in network management and orchestration. As networks become more complex and diverse, there is a growing need for efficient resource allocation, security, trust, and service delivery.  In the 6G era, blockchain technology can play a significant role in enhancing network management and orchestration. Blockchain can provide a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for managing network resources and orchestration. It enables multiple stakeholders, including network operators, service providers, and end-users, to collaborate and trust the system without relying on a central authority.  With blockchain, network resources can be efficiently allocated and shared among multiple entities. Smart contracts, self-executing agreements stored on the blockchain, can automate resource allocation based on predefined rules and current network conditions, enabling dynamic and on-demand resource provisioning.  Blockchain's immutability and cryptographic mechanisms enhance security and business confidentiality in network management and orchestration. It helps prevent unauthorized access, tampering, and fraud, ensuring the integrity of network operations and sensitive data.  Additionally, blockchain-based smart contracts can facilitate the enforcement of SLAs between different entities involved in network management and orchestration. The automated execution and transparency of smart contracts help in monitoring and enforcing SLA compliance, leading to improved service quality and accountability. Blockchain can also enable micropayments, real-time billing, and settlement in network management and orchestration. It allows for transparent and tamper-proof recording of transactions, facilitating automated and secure billing processes among multiple entities involved in network operations. </p>

<p>In this regard, blockchain technology holds many potential applications and benefits for network management and orchestration in the 6G era, unlocking business and operational value to support common tasks such as data processing, networking, and information storage. BLOCK-6G workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers, industry professionals, and academics to explore the intersection of network management, orchestration, and blockchain technology in the 6G era. </p>

<h3>Paper Submission Guideline</h3>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers not under review elsewhere. Papers should be submitted in IEEE 2-column format (Style templates can be found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  Maximum paper lengths, including title, abstract, all figures, tables, and references, are 7 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers.

Regular paper length could include up to 7 pages including references. Short papers are accepted as well and must not exceed 4 pages including references.  </p>

<p> Papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EDAS conference management system, accessible via this <a href="https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=32711" target="_blank">link</a>.
</p>




<p>All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and selected based on their originality, significance, technical soundness, and relevance to the workshop’s theme. For accepted papers, at least one author is expected to register and present the paper in person at the workshop. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore.</p>
