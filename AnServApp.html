<p><span class="cnsm-theme">4th International Workshop on Analytics for Service and Application Management (AnServApp)</span>
  <br/>
  <span class="cn-blue">Monday 28 October 2024</span></p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>With enterprise organizations generating petabytes of data each day, their use of, and reliance on data analytics to provide contextual insight into their operations is imperative for improving the implementation, management and delivery of services and applications. Approaches such as predictive data analytics, data mining, machine learning and deep learning are promising mechanisms to harness this immense stream of service and application data to meet the needs of an organization. The main goal of AnServApp is to present research and work-in-progress results in the area of data analytics, machine learning and cognitive science for service and application management. Its interdisciplinary approach offers practical insights and real-world applications that attendees can apply to their work. In addition to regular papers, short papers describing late-breaking advances and work-in-progress reports from ongoing research are also welcomed. The workshop will feature distinguished speakers, and numerous networking opportunities, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers, practitioners, and industry experts.  </p>
