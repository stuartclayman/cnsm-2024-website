  The most significant square of historical Prague. It originated in the 12th century. The square has several dominant features, the baroque St. Nicholas Church (K. I. Dienzenhofer, 1732–1737), the rococo Kinský Palace housing the National Gallery exhibition hall, the Stone Bell House – a gothic city palace from the 14th century – now the Municipal Gallery concert and exhibition halls, and the Memorial to Master Jan Hus sculptured by Ladislav Saloun (1915). The very place where the 27 Czech noblemen were executed on 21 June, 1621, is marked in the square pavement.

<h4>Charles Bridge</h4>

The oldest Prague bridge built in place of Judita’s Bridge that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. The Stone or Prague Bridge renamed Charles Bridge in 1870, was founded by Charles IV in 1357. According to the latest research the construction was started by Master Otto and finished by Peter Parler in 1402. Both ends of the bridge are fortified by towers (Lesser Town Bridge Tower, Old Town Bridge Tower). From 1683 to 1928 thirty sculptures and sculptural groups of the saints were gradually set on the bridge piers (M. Braun, F. M. Brokof, etc.). The bridge is 515 meters long and 10 meters wide.
