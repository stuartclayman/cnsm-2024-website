<h2 id="key1" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">AI can help improve network security. From better attacks to better defenses</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Sebastian Garcia</h3>

<p>For many years machine learning help optimized resources in network management. It then help to better plan network topologies, bandwidth control, BGP routes, and finally security. Although security defenses is implemented in servers and devices, much of the attacks are simulated and conducted in the network. With the advent of LLMs much technology was dedicated to better explain, to better understand and validate routers configurations, graph analysis, and lately to help the incident responders. However, in security LLMs have a much needed role: to produce better attacks, to produce better detections and to produce better humans.</p>

<h2 id="key2" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">Climbing up the OSI layers and beyond to catch the criminals</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Martin Rehak</h3>

<p>We believe that using AI to catch criminals is fundamentally different from other AI applications due to a unique combination of constraints, e.g. data privacy, compliance, explainability, class imbalance and first and foremost the fact that we are engaging with an intelligent and evasive adversary. We will share the experience gathered along our journey at Czech Technical University, Cognitive Security, Cisco and Resistant AI, where we have deployed machine learning methods to catch criminals across many domains. Starting with network traffic, progressing through web proxy logs and encrypted traffic to combination of all of the above with large-scale malware analysis. We are now focusing on digital fraud and financial crime detection at Resistant AI. During our talk, we will present 10 hypothesis we have validated across many years and domains.</p>

<i>Martin Rehak</i> is the CEO & Founder of Resistant AI, which applies AI to protect customer onboarding, lending, remote identification and insurance claims from fraud and financial crime. A serial entrepreneur, Martin was previously CEO & Founder of Cognitive Security, which was acquired by Cisco in 2013 and became the basis of Cisco’s Cognitive Threat Analytics (CTA) team which provided advanced threat detection by analysis of network traffic for more than 25 million users worldwide. A passionate educator, Martin was a researcher and a lecturer in cybersecurity at the Czech Technical University in Prague for 18 years. He holds an engineering degree from Ecole Centrale Paris and a Ph.D. in AI from CTU in Prague.</p>

<p>Resistant AI’s fraud and financial crime detection gives onboarding, underwriting and anti-money laundering teams bionic eyes to spot fraud the human eye can’t catch in bank statements, pay stubs, incorporation certificates, invoices, utility bills, and other financial documents. Compared to a typical manual process, we catch up to 3x more document fraud in digital PDFs and image formats, can reduce manual reviews by up to 92%, speed up the decisions by 80%. We spot advanced fraud coming from generative AI, online document mills, reused documents, and organized crime. We link the information learned in the onboarding documents with the financial transactions conduced by the onboarded entities to provide layered and resilient defense. </p>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Prof. Luciano Paschoal Gaspary, INF-UFRGS, Brazil</h3>

<p>Recent years have seen remarkable advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), leading to their widespread adoption across various sectors of society. The field of communication networks is no exception to this trend. As a research community, we are actively exploring innovative strategies that leverage AI/ML techniques to address long-standing or emerging problems such as traffic classification, network diagnosis, and intent-based networking. In this context, programmable networks have emerged as a promising framework for executing low-latency, high-throughput AI/ML computations. In this talk, we will examine the synergistic relationship between AI/ML and network programmability in addressing operation and management challenges. We will explore the progress we have made, the lessons we have learned, and the obstacles we face in developing novel AI/ML-enabled management solutions within programmable networks. Additionally, we will highlight ongoing initiatives and identify opportunities for collaboration within our community to further advance this field.</p>
