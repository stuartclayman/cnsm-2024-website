<p><span class="cnsm-theme">1st Workshop on Network Security Operations (NeSecOr)</span>
  <br/>
  <span class="cn-blue">Monday 28 October 2024</span></p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>Automation and orchestration represent a paradigm shift in how security operations are conducted. Automation involves the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention, streamlining processes such as threat detection, incident response, and system remediation. Orchestration goes a step further by integrating these automated tasks into a cohesive workflow, enabling seamless coordination across different security tools and systems. Together, these approaches can significantly improve the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of security operations. </p>

<p>

The workshop will cover key topics including the fundamentals of security automation, the role of orchestration in creating unified security workflows, and best practices for implementing these technologies in a network security environment. Participants will gain hands-on experience with leading automation and orchestration platforms, explore real-world case studies, and engage in interactive sessions designed to solve practical security challenges.

<h3>Paper Submission Guideline</h3>

<p>
Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers not under review elsewhere. Papers should be submitted in IEEE 2-column format (Style templates can be found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">here</a>).  Maximum paper lengths, including title, abstract, all figures, tables, and references, are 7 pages for regular papers and 4 pages for short papers.

Regular paper length could include up to 7 pages including references. Short papers are accepted as well and must not exceed 4 pages including references.  </p>

<p> Papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EDAS conference management system, accessible via this <a href="https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=32710" target="_blank">link</a>.
</p>




<p>All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed and selected based on their originality, significance, technical soundness, and relevance to the workshop’s theme. For accepted papers, at least one author is expected to register and present the paper in person at the workshop. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore.</p>
